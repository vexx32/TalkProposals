# Creating Healthy Open-Source Communities

## Abstract

Open sourcing a project is really only the very first step.
In order to create a great community in and around your project/library/module/resource, you need to be mindful of the human aspect.
This talk aims to shed some light on what is often more implicit than explicit, the unspoken "rules", and how to encourage volunteers to work effectively alongside each other.

## Description

A successful open source project is about a _lot_ more than just some great ideas and effective code.
A one-person or one-team project can really only be taken so far. 
There's a limit to how much a single person or even a single team can do, after all!
In order for a project to go from good to great, just like anything else, it needs a community of people behind it.

In this talk, I'll be covering:

- What's important for creating a welcoming open-source repo (atmosphere, documentation, testing, CI/CD).
- Examples of great contributing processes from stellar repos.
- Some great examples of community interaction & what can come of them.
- How good or bad handling of community submissions can impact a repository over time.
- Some pointers on how to set up your open source repo to help people contribute.
- Ways to avoid miscommunications and work effectively with strangers on the Internet.
- Things to do your best to avoid as a repo owner.
- How to encourage folks to contribute to your repo & help them get started.

# Notes

I've been a contributor to the PowerShell Core repo for over a year now, and I've submitted (checks history) **38** PRs to the repo to date.
30 are complete, 8 in various stages of completion.
I've seen a lot of great examples of interaction between repo maintainers and the community, and this stuff does not get talked about enough.
